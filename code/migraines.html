            <p>Migraine is a common health condition. It affects around 1 in every 5 women and around 1 in every 15 men. They usually begin in early adulthood.</p>
<p>A migraine is usually a moderate or severe headache felt as a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Many people also have symptoms like nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound.</p>
<p>There are several types of migraine, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migraine with aura - where there are warning signs before the migraine begins, like seeing flashing lights</li>
<li>Migraine without aura - the most common type, where the migraine occurs without warning signs</li>
<li>Migraine aura without headache, also known as silent migraine - where an aura or other migraine symptoms are experienced, without a headache</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people have frequent migraines up to several times a week. Other people only have occasional migraines. It's possible for years to pass between migraine attacks.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of a migraine</h2>
<p>The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.</p>
<p>The pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation. The pain gets worse when you move and may prevent you from carrying out normal activities.</p>
<p>Other symptoms associated with a migraine include:</p>
<ul>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>increased sensitivity to light and sound - which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark room</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people experience other symptoms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Poor concentration</li>
<li>Feeling very hot or very cold</li>
<li>Abdominal (tummy) pain</li>
<li>Diarrhoea</li>
<li>Dizziness (light headedness)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone with a migraine experiences these additional symptoms. Some people may experience them without having a headache.</p>
<p>The symptoms of a migraine usually last between 4 hours and 3 days. You may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.</p>
<h2>Causes of a migraine</h2>
<p>The exact cause of migraines is unknown. They're thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.</p>
<p>Around half of all people who experience migraines have a close relative with the condition. This suggests that genes may play a role.</p>
<h2>Treating migraines</h2>
<p>There's no cure for migraines. There are treatments available to help reduce the symptoms. During an attack, many people find that sleeping or lying in a darkened room can also help.</p>
<p>It may take time to work out the best treatment for you. You may need to try different types or combinations of medicines before you find the most effective ones. If you can't manage your migraines using over-the-counter medicines, your MP may prescribe something stronger.</p>
