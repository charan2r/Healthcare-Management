            Dengue Fever
        </h1>
        <br><br><br>

        <div class="editor">
            <p>Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.</p>
<p>Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. But the disease has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and southern parts of the United States.</p>
<p>Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now, in areas where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the mosquito population.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection.</p>
<p>When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses &mdash; such as the flu &mdash; and usually begin four to 10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito.</p>
<p>Dengue fever causes a high fever &mdash; 104 F (40 C) &mdash; and any of the following signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Muscle, bone or joint pain</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Pain behind the eyes</li>
    <li>Swollen glands</li>
    <li>Rash</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.</p>
<p>Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death.</p>
<p>Warning signs of severe dengue fever &mdash; which is a life-threatening emergency &mdash; can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Severe stomach pain</li>
    <li>Persistent vomiting</li>
    <li>Bleeding from your gums or nose</li>
    <li>Blood in your urine, stools or vomit</li>
    <li>Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising</li>
    <li>Difficult or rapid breathing</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Irritability or restlessness</li>
</ul>
      
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses. You can't get dengue fever from being around an infected person. Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites.</p>
<p>The two types of mosquitoes that most often spread the dengue viruses are common both in and around human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito. Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection.</p>
<p>After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term immunity to the type of virus that infected you &mdash; but not to the other three dengue fever virus types. This means you can be infected again in the future by one of the other three virus types. Your risk of developing severe dengue fever increases if you get dengue fever a second, third or fourth time.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2>
<h3>Vaccine</h3>
<p>In areas of the world where dengue fever is common, one dengue fever vaccine (Dengvaxia) is approved for people ages 9 to 45 who have already had dengue fever at least once. The vaccine is given in three doses over the course of 12 months.</p>
<p>The vaccine is approved only for people who have a documented history of dengue fever or who have had a blood test that shows previous infection with one of the dengue viruses &mdash; called seropositivity. In people who have not had dengue fever in the past (seronegative), receiving the vaccine appears to increase the risk of severe dengue fever and hospitalization due to dengue fever in the future.</p> 
<h3>Prevent mosquito bites</h3>
<p>The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an effective tool on its own to reduce dengue fever in areas where the illness is common. Preventing mosquito bites and controlling the mosquito population are still the main methods for preventing the spread of dengue fever.</p>
<p>If you live in or travel to an area where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk of mosquito bites:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing.</strong> The mosquitoes that carry the dengue viruses are most active from dawn to dusk, but they can also bite at night.</li>
    <li><strong>Wear protective clothing.</strong> When you go into mosquito-infested areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes.</li>
    <li><strong>Use mosquito repellent.</strong> Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting. You can also buy clothing made with permethrin already in it. For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a 10% concentration of DEET.</li>
