            <p>Heart failure means that your heart isn't pumping blood around your body as well as it should.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>The symptoms and effects on your body will depend on the side that is affected.</p>
<p>Symptoms of heart failure can be severe. It can be treated though, allowing you to control the effects of the condition and continue to live a normal life.</p>
<p>Heart failure can be caused by a number of conditions such as high blood pressure or heart attack.</p>
<p>It tends to affect people over the age of 65, and is more common in men than women.</p>
<p>The main symptom of heart failure is breathlessness. This, together with some other common symptoms are explained below.</p>
<h3>Breathlessness</h3>
<p>Breathlessness might occur, or become more noticeable, when walking or exerting yourself.</p>
<p>People with more severe heart failure might experience breathlessness when resting and may notice that this gets worse when they lie flat.</p>
<p>During the night, you may wake and feel an urgent need to sit up and get a breath in. A cough and a frothy spit can also accompany the breathlessness.</p>
<h3>Tiredness and lethargy</h3>
<p>Tiredness and lethargy are also common symptoms of heart failure.</p>
<p>This is a result of poor blood flow to the body organs including the muscles.</p>
<h3>Leg swelling</h3>
<p>People with heart failure have a tendency to retain fluid. This appears as swollen ankles and legs because of excess fluid building up.</p>
<p>You may notice that your shoes don't fit and socks appear tight or leave a prominent indent above the ankle.</p>
<h3>Loss of appetite</h3>
<p>People with heart failure can also notice a loss of appetite.</p>
<p>This is because the liver and stomach can become enlarged, due to excess fluid, making you feel sick (nausea) and have a loss of appetite.</p>
<h2>Causes of heart failure</h2>
<p>In many cases, the cause of heart failure is unknown or uncertain.</p>
<p>Conditions that can cause heart failure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>heart attack (coronary heart disease)</li>
<li>inherited heart disease (for example, cardiomyopathy)</li>
<li>high blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
<li>heart rhythm or valve abnormalities</li>
<li>viral infection and damage from the immune system (myocarditis)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Heart failure on left and right side</h3>
<p>Heart failure on the left side can sometimes lead to heart failure on the right side.</p>
<h2>Treating heart failure</h2>
<p>Heart failure results from impairment of the heart's pumping action. Commonly this is related to heart muscle damage that cannot be repaired. However, many treatments available can help to keep the condition under control and help to relieve the symptoms.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the conditions that cause heart failure can also be treated effectively. This reduces the pressure on your heart and prevents further deterioration.</p>
<h3>Medicines</h3>
<p>The information below highlights the medication that you may be prescribed by your GP or specialist. This will be after discussing treatment options with you and identifying the appropriate choice for your individual circumstances.</p>
<h3>Standard medicines</h3>
<p>The standard medicines for treating heart failure are:</p>
<ul>
<li>angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</li>
<li>angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)</li>
<li>beta blockers</li>
<li>diuretics (water tablets)</li>
<li>mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</h3>
<p>ACE inhibitors relax and widen your blood vessels. This helps to improve the flow of blood around your body, which reduces the amount of work your heart has to do.</p>
<p>ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve the symptoms of heart failure, reduce the need for hospital admission and improve life expectancy caused by heart failure.</p>
<p>Your symptoms should improve within a few weeks of starting treatment.</p>
<p>The main side effects of ACE inhibitors are dizziness (caused by your blood pressure being too low) and a cough. You will need to have regular blood tests, at least once every year, while taking an ACE inhibitor.</p>
<p>If you are taking an ACE inhibitor, you should check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) should not be taken with an ACE inhibitor. You should also avoid products containing high levels of potassium, such as salt substitutes.</p>
<h3>Types of ACE inhibitors</h3>
<p>Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril</p>
<h3>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)</h3>
<p>ARBs work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors.</p>
<p>Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not cause a cough. For this reason, they are often prescribed for people who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor due to cough.</p>
<h3>Types of ARBs</h3>
<p>Candesartan and valsartan</p>
<h3>Beta-blockers</h3>
<p>If your heart isn't working properly, your body produces hormones to try and make it work better by making your heart pump faster and raising your blood pressure. However, if this continues, it can have harmful effects on your heart.</p>
<p>Beta-blockers block the action of these hormones. This slows your heart down and reduces your blood pressure, meaning that the heart has less work to do.</p>
<p>Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce the symptoms of heart failure, reduce the need for hospital admission and improve life expectancy caused by heart failure.</p>
<p>People with moderate or severe heart failure usually need to start with a low dose of beta-blocker, which will be slowly increased. This is because some people experience a temporary increase in their heart failure symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>If you feel that your symptoms are getting worse, do not stop your beta blocker. Seek medical advice.</p>
<h3>Types of beta blockers</h3>
<p>Bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol</p>
<h3>Diuretics (water tablets)</h3>
<p>When you have heart failure, your heart cannot pump blood around your body as well as it should, so fluid builds up in your body. This fluid can collect in your lungs, making you breathless, or in your legs and ankles, making them swell (oedema). Diuretics increase the amount of water and salt that is removed from your body as urine. As more fluid passes out, there is less fluid left in your blood, so the excess water in your lungs and legs is drawn back into your blood, relieving your symptoms of breathlessness and oedema.</p>
<p>Diuretics are usually taken in the morning. The effect of making you pass more water starts about half an hour after taking them, and you may find you need to go to the toilet several times over the next few hours. Their effect wears off after about 6 hours, so you should not need to get up at night to go to the toilet.</p>
<p>The accumulation of fluid in your body can be measured as a gain in weight, and the loss of fluid (caused by the diuretic) can be measured as weight loss. Therefore by weighing yourself every day you can pick up any sudden increase in weight.</p>
<p>A sudden increase in weight means that your heart failure is not well controlled and you should seek help urgently from your doctor or heart failure nurse.</p>
<h3>Types of diuretics</h3>
<p>Bumetanide and furosemide</p>
<h3>Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)</h3>
<p>MRAs work by blocking the action of a chemical called aldosterone in the body. Aldosterone causes salt and fluid to build up, so MRAs help to prevent this, reducing the symptoms of heart failure, reducing the need for hospital admission and improving life expectancy caused by heart failure.</p>
<p>The main side effect of MRAs is dizziness (caused by your blood pressure being too low). You will need regular blood tests, at least twice a year, to measure a salt called potassium which can become too high in some people.</p>
<p>If you are taking an MRA, you should check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) should not be taken with an MRA. You should also avoid products containing high levels of potassium, such as salt substitutes.</p>
<p>If you experience diarrhoea and/or vomiting, stop the MRA and contact your doctor.</p>
