        <div class="editor">
            <p>Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid. It's vital for the normal functioning of the body. Cell membranes, hormones and vitamin D are created by your body using cholesterol.</p>
<p>There are 2 main sources of the cholesterol in your blood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cholesterol in the food you eat</li>
<li>Cholesterol produced by your liver</li>
</ul>
<p>Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health.</p>
<p>High cholesterol, on its own, doesn't usually cause any symptoms but increases your risk of serious health conditions.</p>
<h2>About cholesterol</h2>
<p>Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoprotein.</p>
<p>High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver. From there it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product. For this reason, HDL is referred to as "good cholesterol" and higher levels are better.</p>
<p>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. If there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries. For this reason, LDL is known as "bad cholesterol".</p>
<p>The amount of cholesterol in the blood, both HDL and LDL , is measured with a blood test.</p>
<p>The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease.</p>
<h2>Why should I lower my cholesterol?</h2>
<p>Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)</li>
<li>heart attack</li>
<li>stroke</li>
<li>transient ischaemic attack (TIA) - often known as a "mini stroke"</li>
<li>peripheral arterial disease (PAD)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body.</p>
<p>Your risk of developing coronary heart disease also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity.</p>
<h2>Causes of high cholesterol</h2>
<p>Many different factors can contribute to high blood cholesterol, including lifestyle factors like smoking, an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, as well as having an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.</p>
<h3>Lifestyle</h3>
<p>Your lifestyle can increase your risk of developing high blood cholesterol.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an unhealthy diet - some foods, such as liver, kidneys and eggs, contain cholesterol (dietary cholesterol), but this has little effect on blood cholesterol: it's the total amount of saturated fat in your diet that's more important to watch.</li>
<li>lack of exercise or physical activity - this can increase your level of "bad cholesterol" (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL)</li>
<li>obesity - if you're overweight, it's likely that you'll have higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)</li>
<li>drinking excessive amounts of alcohol - regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol can increase your cholesterol and triglyceride levels</li>
<li>smoking - a chemical in cigarettes called acrolein stops "good cholesterol" (HDL) transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Underlying conditions</h3>
<p>People with diabetes often have high cholesterol.</p>
<p>Some other health conditions that can also cause raised levels of cholesterol include:</p>
<ul>
<li>chronic kidney disease</li>
<li>liver disease</li>
<li>an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)</li>
</ul>
<p>Treating the underlying condition can help to reduce cholesterol. </p>
<h2>Treating high cholesterol</h2>
<p>If you've been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you'll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise.</p>
<p>After a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn't dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication.</p>
<p>Changing your diet, stopping smoking and exercising more will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing.</p>
<p>The various treatments for high cholesterol are outlined below. </p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Eating a healthy, balanced diet that's low in saturated fats can reduce your level of "bad cholesterol" (LDL).</p>
<p>Try to avoid or cut down on the following foods, which are high in saturated fat:</p>
<ul>
<li>fatty cuts of meat and meat products, such as sausages and pies</li>
<li>butter, ghee and lard</li>
<li>cream, soured cream, crème fraîche and ice cream</li>
<li>cheese, particularly hard cheese</li>
<li>cakes and biscuits</li>
<li>milk chocolate</li>
<li>coconut oil, coconut cream and palm oil</li>
</ul>
<p>The government recommends that a maximum of 11% of a person's food energy should come from saturated fat. This equates to no more than:</p>
<ul>
<li>30g of saturated fat a day for the average man</li>
<li>20g of saturated fat a day for the average woman</li>
</ul>
<p>Children should have less.</p>
<p>Check the labels on the foods you're eating to find out how much saturated fat you're consuming.</p>
<h3>Omega-3 fatty acids</h3>
<p>Many experts believe that the fats found in avocados and oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and tuna, are good for you.</p>
<p>These are known as omega-3 fatty acids and high doses can improve (lower) triglyceride levels in some people. However, too much omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to obesity.</p>
<p>For people with a high triglyceride level, at least two portions of oily fish a week is thought to be beneficial. However, there's no evidence that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements has the same benefit.</p>
<h2>Cholesterol-lowering medication</h2>
<p>There are several different types of cholesterol-lowering medication that work in different ways. Your GP can advise you about the most suitable type of treatment, and may also prescribing medication to lower high blood pressure (hypertension) if it affects you.</p>
<p>The most commonly prescribed medications are outlined below.</p>
<h3>Statins</h3>
<p>Statins block the enzyme (a type of chemical) in your liver that helps to make cholesterol. This leads to a reduction in your blood cholesterol level.</p>
<p>You'll usually be started on a medication called atorvastatin. Other statins include simvastatin and rosuvastatin.</p>
<p>When someone has side effects from using a statin, it's described as having an "intolerance" to it. Side effects of statins include headaches, muscle pain and stomach problems, such as indigestion, diarrhoea or constipation.</p>
<p>Statins will only be prescribed to people who continue to be at high risk of heart disease, because they need to be taken for life. Cholesterol levels start to rise again once you stop taking them.</p>
<h3>Aspirin</h3>
<p>In some cases, a low daily dose of aspirin may be prescribed, depending on your age (usually over 40 years old) and other risk factors.</p>
<p>Low-dose aspirin can help to prevent blood clots forming, particularly for someone who's had a heart attack, has established vascular disease, or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p>
<p>You may also be advised to have periodic blood tests to ensure your liver is functioning well.</p>
