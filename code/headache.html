                <li>your headache occurs after a severe head injury</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You have an extremely painful headache and:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>slurred speech or memory loss</li>
                <li>a very high temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash</li>

                <li>severe pain and redness in one of your eyes</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 >Tension headaches</h2>
<p>Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. They're what we think of as normal, 'everyday' headaches. They feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of the head, as though a tight band is stretched around it.</p>
<p>Normally, tension headaches are not severe enough to prevent you doing everyday activities. They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours, but can last for several days.</p>
<h3>What causes a tension headache?</h3>
<p>The exact cause is unclear, but tension headaches have been linked to things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>stress</li>
<li>poor posture</li>
<li>skipping meals</li>
<li>dehydration</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to treat a tension headache</h3>
<p>You can usually treat tension headaches with painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. Lifestyle changes may also help, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting regular sleep</li>
<li>reducing stress</li>
<li>staying well hydrated</li>
</ul>
<h2>Migraines</h2>
<p>Migraines are less common than tension headaches. They're usually felt as a severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>increased sensitivity to light or sound</li>
</ul>
<p>Migraines can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities. They usually last at least a couple of hours. Some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time.</p>
<h3>How to treat migraines</h3>
<p>Most people can treat their migraines with over-the-counter medication from the pharmacist.</p>
<p>If your migraines are severe, you may need to be prescribed stronger medication by your GP. This may be able to relieve and prevent your migraines.</p>

<h2>Cluster headaches</h2>
<p>Cluster headaches are a rare type of headache. They occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year.<br /><br />Cluster headaches are excruciatingly painful. They cause intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as a:</p>
<ul>
<li>watering or red eye</li>
<li>blocked or runny nose</li>
</ul>
<p>Pharmacy medications don't usually ease the symptoms of a cluster headache. Your GP can prescribe specific treatments to ease the pain and help prevent further attacks.</p>
<h2>Medication and painkiller headaches</h2>
<p>Some headaches are a side effect of taking a particular medication. Frequent headaches can also be caused by taking too many painkillers. This is known as a painkiller or medication-overuse headache.</p>
<p>A medication-overuse headache will usually get better within a few weeks once you stop taking the painkillers that are causing it. But, pain may get worse for a few days before it starts to improve.</p>
<h2>Hormone headaches</h2>
<p>Headaches in women are often caused by hormones, and many women notice a link with their periods. The menopause and pregnancy are also potential triggers.</p>
<p>You may be able to help reduce headaches associated with your menstrual cycle by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing your stress levels</li>
<li>having a regular sleeping pattern</li>
<li>making sure you do not miss meals</li>
</ul>
