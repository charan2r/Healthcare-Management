            <p>Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment.</p>
<p>In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus.</p>
<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
<p>The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later.</p>
<p>The main symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling sick (nausea)</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Stomach cramps and abdominal pain</li>
<li>Loss lack of energy and weakness</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>A high temperature (fever)</li>
<li>Aching muscles</li>
<li>Chills</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery.</p>
<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below).</p>
<p>Until you feel better, you should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it.</p>
<p>Eat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods - such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice - until you begin to feel better.</p>
<p>Oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition.</p>
<h2>How is food contaminated?</h2>
<p>Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat)</li>
<li>not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C</li>
<li>leaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures</li>
<li>not sufficiently reheating previously cooked food</li>
<li>someone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food</li>
<li>eating food that has passed its "use by" date</li>
<li>the spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes of food poisoning</h2>
<p>Food can become contaminated at any stage during its production, processing or cooking.</p>
<p>For example, it can become contaminated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat)</li>
<li>not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C</li>
<li>keeping cooked food unrefrigerated for a long period</li>
<li>eating food that has been touched by someone who is ill or has been in contact with someone with a diarrhoea and vomiting</li>
<li>cross-contamination (where harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating food poisoning</h2>
<p>Food poisoning can usually be treated at home without seeking medical advice. Most people will feel better within a few days.</p>
<p>It's important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water, even if you can only sip it, as you need to replace any fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
<p>You should also:</p>
<ul>
<li>rest as much as possible</li>
<li>eat when you feel up to it - sticking to small, light and non-fatty meals at first (bland foods such as toast, crackers, rice and bananas are good choices)</li>
<li>avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks and spicy and fatty foods because they may make you feel worse</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your MP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve in a few days.</p>
<h2>Preventing the spread of infection</h2>
<p>If you have food poisoning, you shouldn't prepare food for other people and you should try to keep contact with vulnerable people, such as the elderly or very young, to a minimum.</p>
<p>Stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea.</p>
