        <div class="editor">
            <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints.</p>
<p>The hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body.</p>
<p>There may be periods where your symptoms become worse, known as a flare-up or flare. A flare can be difficult to predict, but with treatment it is possible to decrease the number of flares and minimise or prevent long-term damage to the joints.</p>
<h2>When to seek medical advice</h2>
<p>You should see your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so your GP can try to identify the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage.</p>
<h2>What causes rheumatoid arthritis?</h2>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system - which usually fights infection - attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful.</p>
<p>Over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone.</p>
<p>It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you are at an increased risk if you are a woman, you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, or you smoke.</p>
<h2>Who is affected</h2>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis affects around 400,000 people in the UK.</p>
<p>It can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. About three times as many women as men are affected.</p>
<h2>How rheumatoid arthritis is treated</h2>
<p>There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment.</p>
<p>The main treatment options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>medication that is taken in the long-term to relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the condition</li>
<li>supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, to help keep you mobile and find ways around any problems you have with daily activities</li>
<li>surgery to correct any joint problems that develop. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis</h2>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects the joints, although it can cause problems in other parts of the body too.</p>
<p>The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis often develop gradually over several weeks, but some cases can progress quickly over a number of days.</p>
<p>The symptoms vary from person to person. They can come and go, and may change over time. You may occasionally experience flares when your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more severe.</p>
<h2>Symptoms affecting the joints</h2>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a condition that affects the joints. It can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected.</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the joints are outlined below.</p>
<h3>Pain</h3>
<p>The joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity.</p>
<h3>Stiffness</h3>
<p>Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. For example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist.</p>
<p>Like joint pain, the stiffness is often more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis called osteoarthritis usually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often lasts longer than this.</p>
<h3>Swelling, warmth and redness</h3>
<p>The lining of joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch.</p>
<p>In some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints.</p>
<h2>Additional symptoms</h2>
<p>As well as problems affecting the joints, some people with rheumatoid arthritis experience a range of more general symptoms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiredness and a lack of energy</li>
<li>a high temperature (fever)</li>
<li>sweating</li>
<li>a poor appetite</li>
<li>weight loss</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes of rheumatoid arthritis</h2>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by the body's immune system attacking itself. However, it is not yet known what triggers this.</p>
<p>Normally, your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping fight infection. But if you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint.</p>
<p>This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed.</p>
<p>This inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby:</p>
<ul>
<li>bones</li>
<li>cartilage - the stretchy connective tissue between bones</li>
<li>tendons - the tissue that connects bone to muscle</li>
<li>ligaments - the tissue that connects bone and cartilage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating rheumatoid arthritis</h2>
<h2>Stopping the condition progressing</h2>
<p>There are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems.</p>
<p>These are often divided into two types of medication: 'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)' and 'biological treatments'.</p>
<h2>Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)</h2>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you will normally be offered a combination of DMARD tablets as part of your initial treatment, as these medications are particularly effective in easing symptoms of the condition and slowing down its progression.</p>
<p>DMARDs work by blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.</p>
<p>There are many different DMARDs that can be used, including methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.</p>
<p>Methotrexate is normally the first medicine given for rheumatoid arthritis, often alongside another DMARD and a short-course of corticosteroids to relieve any pain (see below). It may also be combined with the biological treatments mentioned below.</p>
<p>Common side effects of methotrexate include feeling sick, loss of appetite, a sore mouth, diarrhoea,>headaches and hair loss. The medication can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver, so you will have regular blood tests to monitor this.</p>
<p>Less commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you will usually have a chest X-ray and possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you develop shortness of breath or a persistent dry cough while taking it. However, most people tolerate methotrexate well.</p>
<p>It can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It is important to keep taking the medication, even if you do not notice it working at first.</p>
<p>You may have to try two or three types of DMARD before you find the one that is most suitable for you. Once you and your doctor work out the most suitable DMARD, you will usually have to take the medicine in the long term.</p>
<h2>Biological treatments</h2>
<p>Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. They include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab.</p>
<p>They are usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD and are normally only used if these medications alone have not been effective.</p>
<p>Biological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints.</p>
<p>Side effects from biological treatments are usually mild and include skin reactions at the site of the injections, infections, feeling sick, a high temperature (fever) and headaches.</p>
<p>Some people may also be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as tuberculosis (TB) in people who have had them in the past.</p>
<h2>Relieving pain</h2>
<p>In addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain.</p>
<p>Some of the different medicines that may be used to relieve pain are outlined below.</p>
<h2>1.Painkillers</h2>
<p>In some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such as paracetamol, or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>These medications don't help treat the underlying inflammation of your joints, but they can sometimes be helpful in relieving pain. For example, they may be recommended while you are waiting to see a specialist or during periods where your symptoms are particularly bad (flare-ups).</p>
<h2>3.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</h2>
<p>In addition to - or instead of - the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)</a>.</p>
<p>This may be a traditional NSAID (such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib).</p>
<p>These medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time.</p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them.</p>
<p>Although uncommon, taking an NSAID tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems - such as internal bleeding - because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids.</p>
<p>If you are prescribed an NSAID tablet, you will often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), as well. Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining.</p>
<h2>3.Corticosteroids</h2>
<p>Corticosteroids are powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation.</p>
<p>They can be used as a tablet (for example, prednisolone), as an injection directly into a painful joint, or as an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints).</p>
<p>They are usually used to provide short-term pain relief - for example, while you are waiting for DMARD medication to take effect or during a flare-up.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, osteoporosis(thinning of the bones), easy bruising, muscle weakness and thinning of the skin.</p>
