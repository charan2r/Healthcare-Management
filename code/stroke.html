        <div class="editor">
            <p>A stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.</p>
<p>Strokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential. The sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage to the brain is likely to occur.</p>
<p>Even if the symptoms of a stroke go away, you or the person having a stroke should still go to hospital for an assessment.</p>
<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
<p>The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST. FAST stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Face - the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop</li>
<li>Arms - the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm</li>
<li>Speech - they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake</li>
<li>Time - it's time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes, but occasionally a stroke can cause different symptoms which might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete paralysis of one side of the body</li>
<li>sudden loss or blurring of vision</li>
<li>difficulty understanding what others are saying</li>
<li>problems with balance and co-ordination</li>
<li>a sudden and very severe headache</li>
<li>loss of feeling in one side of the body</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why do strokes happen?</h2>
<p>Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death.</p>
<p>There are 2 main causes of strokes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ischaemic  where the blood supply is stopped due to a blood clot (this accounts for 85% of all cases)</li>
<li>haemorrhagic - where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts</li>
</ul>
<h3>How can I reduce my risk of stroke?</h3>
<p>In most cases it's possible to significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke by making lifestyle changes like</p>
<ul>
    <li>eating a healthy diet - a low-fat, low-salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains</li>
    <li>exercising regularly - this can help lower your cholesterol level and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level</li>
    <li>stopping smoking if you smoke</li>
    </ul>
