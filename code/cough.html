        <div class="editor">
            <p>A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke. It's rarely a sign of anything serious. </p>
<p>Most coughs clear up within 3 weeks and don't require any treatment.</p>
<p>A dry cough means it's tickly and doesn't produce any phlegm (thick mucus). A chesty cough means phlegm is produced to help clear your airways.</p>
<h2>Short-term coughs</h2>
<p>Common causes of a short-term cough include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) that affects the throat, windpipe or sinuses - examples are a cold,flu, laryngitis, sinusitis orwhooping cough</a></li>
<li>a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) that affects your lungs or lower airways - examples are acute bronchitis or pneumonia</li>
<li>an allergy</li>
<li>a flare-up of a long-term condition such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis</a></li>
<li>inhaled dust or smoke</li>
</ul>
<p>In rare cases, a short-term cough may be the first sign of a health condition that causes a persistent cough.</p>
<h2>Persistent coughs</h2>
<p>A persistent cough may be caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A long-term respiratory tract infection, such as chronic bronchitis  </li>
<li>Asthma - this also usually causes other symptoms, such as wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath</li>
<li>An allergy</li>
<li>Smoking - a smoker's cough can also be a symptom of COPD</li>
<li>Bronchiectasis - where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened</li>
<li>Postnasal drip - mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose, caused by a condition such as rhinitis or sinusitis</li>
<li>a prescribed medicine, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which is used to treat high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, a doctor won't worry whether a cough is dry or chesty, but will need to know if you are producing much more or darker phlegm than usual.</p>
<p>Rarely, a persistent cough can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as tuberculosis. </p>
<h2>Coughs in children</h2>
<p>Coughs in children often have similar causes to those mentioned above. For example, respiratory tract infections, asthma and GORD can all affect children.</p>
<p>Causes of coughs that are more common in children than adults include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bronchiolitis - a mild respiratory tract infection that usually causes cold-like symptoms</li>
<li>croup - this causes a distinctive barking cough and a harsh sound known as stridor when the child breathes in</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cough medicines and remedies</h3>
<p>Although some people find them helpful, medicines that claim to suppress your cough or stop you bringing up phlegm are not usually recommended. This is because there's little evidence to suggest they're any better than simple home remedies, and they're not suitable for everyone.</p>
<p>A homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take. Honey shouldn't be given to babies under the age of one because of the risk of infant botulism.</p>
<h3>Treating the underlying cause</h3>
<p>If your cough has a specific cause, treating this may help. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>asthma can be treated with inhaled steroids to reduce inflammation in your airways</li>
<li>allergies can be treated by avoiding things you're allergic to and taking antihistamines to dampen down your allergic reactions</li>
<li>bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics</li>
<li>GORD can be treated with antacids to neutralise your stomach acid and medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces</li>
<li>COPD can be treated with bronchodilators to widen your airways</li>
</ul>
<p>If you smoke, quitting is also likely to help improve your cough
