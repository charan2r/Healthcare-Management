        <div class="editor">
            <p>Diarrhoea is passing looser or more frequent stools than is normal for you.</p>
<p>It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week.</p>
<h2>What causes diarrhoea?</h2>
<p>There are many different causes of diarrhoea, but a bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children.</p>
<p>Gastroenteritis can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virus - such as norovirus or rotavirus</li>
<li>Bacteria - such as campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food </li>
<li>A parasite - such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water</li>
</ul>
<p>These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers' diarrhoea.</p>
<p>Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a food allergy, medication, or a long-term condition, such as >irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</p>
<h2>What to do if you have diarrhoea</h2>
<p>Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment, and you may not need to see your GP.</p>
<p>However, diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, so you should drink plenty of fluids - small, frequent sips of water - until it passes. It's very important that babies and small children do not become dehydrated.</p>
<p>Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration.</p>
<p>You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal.</p>
<p>Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others.</p>
<p>Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary, and most types should not be given to children.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of diarrhoea</h2>
<p>Diarrhoea is where you frequently pass watery or loose poo. Some people may also have other symptoms, depending on the cause.</p>
<p>Associated symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>stomach cramps</li>
<li>nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>headache</a></li>
<li>loss of appetite</li>
</ul>
<p>The excessive loss of water in your poo can also sometimes lead to dehydration, which can be serious if it's not recognised and treated quickly.</p>
<h2>Signs of dehydration</h2>
<p>Signs of dehydration in children can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>irritability or drowsiness</li>
<li>passing urine infrequently</li>
<li>pale or mottled skin</li>
<li>cold hands and feet</li>
<li>they look or feel increasingly unwell</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs of dehydration in adults can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiredness and a lack of energy</li>
<li>loss of appetite</li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>feeling lightheaded</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>dry tongue</li>
<li>sunken eyes</li>
<li>muscle cramps</li>
<li>rapid heartbeat</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating diarrhoea</h2>
<p>Diarrhoea will usually clear up without treatment after a few days, particularly if it's caused by an infection.</p>
<p>In children, diarrhoea will usually pass within 5 to 7 days and will rarely last longer than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>In adults, diarrhoea usually improves within 2 to 4 days, although some infections can last a week or more.</p>
<p>While waiting for your diarrhoea to pass, you can ease your symptoms by following the advice outlined below.</p>
<h2>Drink fluids</h2>
<p>It's important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, particularly if you're also vomiting. Take small, frequent sips of water.</p>
<p>Ideally, adults should drink a lot of liquids that contain water, salt, and sugar. Examples are water mixed with juice and soup broth. If you're drinking enough fluid, your urine will be light yellow or almost clear.</p>
<p>It's also very important for babies and small children not to become dehydrated. Give your child frequent sips of water, even if they are vomiting. A small amount is better than none. </p>
<p>Fruit juice or fizzy drinks should be avoided as they can make diarrhoea worse in children.</p>
<p>If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should continue to feed them as normal.</p>
<p>Contact your GP immediately if you or your child develop any symptoms of dehydration</a>.</p>
<h2>Oral rehydration solutions</h2>
<p>Your GP or pharmacist may suggest using an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to prevent dehydration if you're at risk - for example, if you're frail or elderly. ORS can also be used to treat dehydration that has already occurred.</p>
<p>Rehydration solutions usually come in sachets available from your local pharmacist without a prescription. They are dissolved in water and replace salt, glucose, and other important minerals that are lost if you are dehydrated.</p>
<h2>Medication</h2>
<h3>Antidiarrhoeal medicines</h3>
<p>Antidiarrhoeal medicines may help reduce your diarrhoea and slightly shorten how long it lasts. However, they're not usually necessary.</p>
<p>Loperamide is the main antidiarrhoeal medicine used, as it has been shown to be effective and causes few side effects.</p>
<p>Loperamide slows down the muscle movements in your gut so more water is absorbed from your stools. This makes your stools firmer and they're passed less frequently.</p>
<p>An alternative to loperamide is a different type of antidiarrhoeal medicine called racecadotril, which works by reducing the amount of water produced by the small intestine. Evidence suggests this medication may be as effective as loperamide for treating diarrhoea.</p>
<p>Some antidiarrhoeal medicines can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to find out whether it's suitable for you and what dose you should take. Ask your pharmacist for advice if you're unsure.</p>
<p>Do not take antidiarrhoeal medicines if there is blood or mucus in your stools or you have a high temperature (fever). Instead, you should contact your GP for advice.</p>
<p>Most antidiarrhoeal medicines should not be given to children. Racecadotril can be used in children over 3 months old if it's combined with oral rehydration and the other measures mentioned above, although not all doctors recommend it.</p>
