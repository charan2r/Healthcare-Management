            <p>Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures.</p>
            <p>Epilepsy affects more than 600,000 people in the world. Almost one in every 100 people has the condition.</p>
            <h2>Symptoms of epilepsy</h2>
<p>The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects.</p>
<p>The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.</p>
<p>The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a "trance-like" state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).</p>
<p>Some people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.</p>
<h3>Types of seizures</h3>
<p>People with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.</p>
<p>Seizures can occur when you're awake or asleep.</p>
<p>The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focal (or partial) seizures - where only a small part of the brain is affected</li>
<li>Generalised seizures - where most or all of the brain is affected</li>
</ul>
<h4>1.Focal seizures</h4>
<p>Symptoms of a focal aware seizure can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a general strange feeling that is hard to describe</li>
<li>a "rising" feeling in your tummy - sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride</li>
<li>an intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu)</li>
<li>experiencing an unusual smell or taste</li>
<li>a tingling sensation, or "pins and needles", in your arms and legs</li>
<li>a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy</li>
<li>stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or hand</li>
</ul>
<p>These seizures are sometimes known as "warnings" or "auras", because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way. This can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you're in a safe place.</p>
<h4>2.Generalised seizures</h4>
<p>There are 6 main types of generalised seizure.</p>
<h3>i.Absence seizures</h3>
<p>Absences can occur several times a day. They may affect a child's performance at school. They can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, like crossing a busy road.</p>
<h3>ii.Myoclonic seizures</h3>
<p>These types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. They often only last for a fraction of a second, and you'll normally remain conscious during this time.</p>
<p>Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up. They can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures.</p>
<h3>iii.Clonic seizures</h3>
<p><span>These cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except the symptoms will last longer, normally up to 2 minutes. You might lose consciousness during a clonic seizure.</span></p>
<h3>iv.Atonic seizures</h3>   
<p><span>Atonic seizures cause all your muscles to relax suddenly. There's a chance you may fall to the ground and you could injure yourself.</span></p>
<h3>v.Tonic seizures</h3>
<p><span>Tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff. You might lose balance and fall over. Like atonic seizures, there's a risk of injury.</span></p>
<h3>vi.Tonic clonic seizures</h3>
<p>Tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions have 2 stages. Your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. You'll lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. The seizure normally lasts a minute, but can last longer.</p>
<p>This type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit.</p>
<h2>Immediate action required:
Phone 999 if</h2>
<ul>
    <li>the seizure has not stopped after 5 minutes</li>
    <li>the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between</li>
    <li>you know it's the person's first seizure</li>
    <li>the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason</li>
    <li>the person's behaviour after a seizure is unsafe</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Causes of epilepsy</h2>
<p>In some cases of epilepsy a cause cannot be found.</p>
<p>If there's an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition.</p>
<p>The brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures.</p>
<h2>Treating epilepsy</h2>
<p>Most people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring.</p>
<p>There are many different ASMs. They work by changing the levels of the chemicals in your brain that conduct electrical impulses. This reduces the chance of a seizure.</p>
<p>The type of ASM recommended for you will depend on a number of factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of seizures you have</li>
<li>your age</li>
<li>whether there are any concerns about a certain ASM interacting with other medicines (like the contraceptive pill)</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of commonly used ASMs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam.</p>
