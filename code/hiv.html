        <div class="editor">
            <p>HIV is a long term health condition which is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease.</p>
<p>Nowadays, HIV treatment can stop the virus spreading and if used early enough, can reverse damage to the immune system.</p>
<p>HIV is most commonly transmitted through having unprotected sex with someone with HIV who isn't taking HIV treatment. Unprotected sex means having sex without taking HIV PrEP or using condoms.</p>
<p>HIV can also be transmitted by:</p>
<ul>
<li>sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment</li>
<li>an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding</li>
</ul>
<p>All pregnant women are offered an HIV test and if the virus is found, they can be offered treatment which virtually eliminates risk to their child during pregnancy and birth.</p>
<p>People who take HIV treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can't pass HIV on to others. Although there is no cure for HIV yet, people living with HIV who take their treatment should have normal lifespans and live in good health.</p>
<p>Without treatment, people with HIV will eventually become unwell. HIV can be fatal if it's not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. It's extremely important to test for HIV if you think you've been exposed.</p>
<h2>How do you get HIV?</h2>
<p>HIV is found in body fluids of a person with the virus, whose levels of virus are detectable.</p>
<p>The body fluids most likely to contain enough virus to pass on HIV to another person are:</p>
<ul>
<li>semen (including pre-cum)</li>
<li>vaginal fluid</li>
<li>anal mucus</li>
<li>blood</li>
<li>breast milk</li>
</ul>
<p>HIV is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.</p>
<p>HIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected anal or vaginal sex. There is a very low risk of getting HIV through oral sex and there can be a small risk through sharing sex toys, which can be eliminated by using fresh condoms for each person using the toy.</p>
<h2>How do I know if I have HIV?</h2>
<p>Seek healthcare advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.</p>
<p>The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or occasionally saliva for signs of the infection. In NHS services this usually involves a blood test with results available within a few days.</p>
<p>Some services, including HIV or sexual health charities, may provide saliva tests. Saliva tests that indicate a person may have HIV will need to be confirmed through a blood test.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of HIV</h2>
<p>People who are infected with HIV, often experience a short flu like illness that occurs 2 to 6 weeks after infection. This is known as primary HIV infection.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>fever (raised temperature)</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>body rash</li>
</ul>
<p>Other symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiredness</li>
<li>joint pain</li>
<li>muscle pain</li>
<li>swollen glands (nodes)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these symptoms are most commonly caused by conditions other than HIV, and do not mean you have the virus.</p>
<p>If you have several of these symptoms, and you think you have been at risk of HIV infection within the past few weeks, you should get an HIV test.</p>
<p>After the initial symptoms disappear, HIV may often not cause any further symptoms for many years. During this time, HIV continues to be active and causes progressive damage to your immune system.</p>
<p>Once the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>weight loss</li>
<li>chronic diarrhoea</li>
<li>night sweats</li>
<li>skin problems</li>
<li>recurrent infections</li>
<li>serious life-threatening illnesses</li>
</ul>
<h2>How is HIV transmitted?</h2>
<p>HIV is not passed on easily from one person to another. The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses.</p>
<p>HIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids. To get HIV, one of these fluids from someone with HIV (who has detectable levels of virus in their body) has to get into your blood.</p>
<p>The body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>semen (including precum)</li>
<li>vaginal fluids, including menstrual blood</li>
<li>breast milk</li>
<li>blood</li>
<li>lining inside the anus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating HIV</h2>
<p>Although HIV cannot be cured, it's a very manageable long term condition and effective treatment is available to enable individuals to live a long and healthy life.</p>
<p>If you're diagnosed with HIV, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for treatment, regular monitoring and care.</p>
<p>It's recommended that everyone diagnosed with HIV starts treatment shortly after being diagnosed to keep in good health and free of symptoms. Treatment for HIV is generally very well tolerated.<br /><br /> Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets which need to be taken every day.<br /><br /> HIV can develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but by taking a combination of different drugs or with support from your doctor in taking your treatment, resistance is less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it's vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.<br /><br /> For people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is "undetectable" in blood tests) will prevent you passing on HIV to sexual partners.</p>
<h3>Missing a dose</h3>
<p>HIV treatment works best if you take your pills regularly every day. You will need to develop a daily routine to fit your treatment plan around your lifestyle.</p>
