            <p>A cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper airways. It's very common and usually clears up on its own within a week or two.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of a cold include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sore throat</li>
<li>A blocked or runny nose</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>A cough</li>
</ul>
<p>More severe symptoms, including a high temperature (fever), headache and aching muscles can also occur, although these tend to be associated more with flu.</p>
<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>There's no cure for a cold, but you can look after yourself at home by:</p>
<ul>
<li>resting, drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily</li>
<li>taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen, to reduce any fever or discomfort</li>
<li>using decongestant sprays or tablets to relieve a blocked nose</li>
<li>trying remedies such as gargling salt water and sucking on menthol sweets</li>
</ul>
<p>Many painkillers and decongestants are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They're generally safe for older children and adults to take, but might not be suitable for babies, young children, pregnant women, people with certain underlying health conditions, and those taking certain other medications. Speak to a pharmacist if you're unsure.</p>
<p>The symptoms of a cold usually develop within a few days of becoming infected.</p>
<p>The main symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sore throat</li>
<li>a blocked or runny nose</li>
<li>sneezing</li>
<li>a cough</li>
<li>a hoarse voice</li>
<li>generally feeling unwell</li>
</ul>
<p>Less common symptoms of a cold include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a high temperature (fever) - this is usually about 37-39C (98.6-102.2F)</li>
<li>a headache</li>
<li>muscle pain</li>
<li>loss of taste and smell</li>
<li>mild irritation of your eyes</li>
<li>a feeling of pressure in your ears and face  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating a common cold</h2>
<p>You can manage cold symptoms yourself by following some simple advice. You'll normally start to feel better within 7 to 10 days.</p>
<h2>General advice</h2>
<p>Until you're feeling better, it may help to:</p>
<ul>
<li>drink plenty of fluids to replace those lost from sweating and having a runny nose </li>
<li>eat healthily - a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables</li>
</ul>
<p>You may lose your appetite when you have a cold. This is perfectly normal and should only last a few days. Don't force yourself to eat if you're not feeling hungry.</p>
<p>You may also wish to try some of the medications and remedies described below to help relieve your symptoms.</p>
