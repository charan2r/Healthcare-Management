            <p>Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you're not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel.</p>
<p>Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small.</p>
<p>The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life.</p>
<h2>What causes constipation?</h2>
<p>It's often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals</li>
<li>a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits</li>
<li>ignoring the urge to pass stools</li>
<li>side effects of certain medications</li>
<li>not drinking enough fluids</li>
<li>anxiety or depression</li>
</ul>
<p>In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation.</p>
<h2>Who's affected</h2>
<p>Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It's estimated that around 1 in every 7 adults and up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any one time.</p>
<p>The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Constipation isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.</p>
<p>Also speak to your pharmacist if you think your child might be constipated. Laxatives are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don't help and the problem continues, you should see your pharmacist.</p>
<p>However, you should see your GP for advice if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you notice any rectal bleeding</li>
<li>you notice any unexplained weight loss</li>
<li>you have persistent tiredness</li>
<li>your constipation lasts longer than 14 days without improvement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating constipation</h2>
<p>Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation.</p>
<p>This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise.</p>
<p>If these aren't effective, your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels.</p>
<p>Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established.</p>  
<p>The various treatments for constipation are outlined below. </p>
<h2>Lifestyle advice</h2>
<p>Changes to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. In many cases, this will improve the condition without the need for medication.</p>
<p>Some self-help methods of treating constipation are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase your daily intake of fibre. You should eat at least 18-30g of fibre a day. High-fibre foods include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals.</li>
<li>Add some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet. This will help to make your stools softer and easier to pass.</li>
<li>Avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water.</li>
<li>Exercise more regularly - for example, by going for a daily walk or run.</li>
<li>If constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol. Always follow the dosage instructions carefully. Children under 16 shouldn't take aspirin.</li>
<li>Keep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you're able to spend time on the toilet. Respond to your bowel's natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don't delay.</li>
<li>Try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier. </li>
<li>If medication you're taking could be causing constipation, your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don't help.</p>
<h2>Laxatives</h2>
<p>Laxatives are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system.</p>
<h3>Bulk-forming laxatives</h3>
<p>Your pharmacist will usually start you on a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass.</p>
<p>Commonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk, methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don't take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative.</p>
