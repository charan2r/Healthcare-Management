        <div class="editor">
            <p>High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is usually defined as having a sustained blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above.</p>
<p>The line between normal and raised blood pressure is not fixed and depends on your individual circumstances. However, most doctors agree that the ideal blood pressure for a physically healthy person is around 120/80mmHg.</p>
<p>A normal blood pressure reading is classed as less than 130/80mmHg.</p>
<h2>The heart (blood pump)</h2>
<p>The heart is a muscle that is designed to constantly pump blood around the body. It pumps blood that is low in oxygen towards the lungs, through the venous 'pipeline' (veins), where it receives a fresh supply of oxygen.</p>
<p>Once the blood is fully oxygenated, the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood around the body so that the oxygen can be used by the body's muscles and cells, through the arterial 'pipeline' (arteries).</p>
<h2>How is blood pressure measured?</h2>
<p>Blood pressure is defined as the amount of pressure that is exerted on the artery walls as blood moves through them. It is measured in millimetres of mercury, or mmHg.</p>
<p>A more detailed explanation is provided below.</p>
<p>Two measurements are used to measure blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systolic pressure - the measure of blood pressure exerted when your heart beats and forces blood around your body.</li>
<li>Diastolic pressure - the measure of blood pressure when your heart is resting in between beats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</p>
<p>The figures are usually represented with the systolic pressure first, followed by the diastolic pressure. Therefore, if your MP says that your blood pressure is '120 over 80', or 120/80mmHg, they mean that you have a systolic pressure of 120mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of high blood pressure</h2>
<p>High blood pressure does not usually cause any obvious symptoms. Symptoms can occur in rare cases where a person has a very high blood pressure level so it is good to be aware of these.</p>
<p>The symptoms may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Blurred or double vision</li>
<li>Regular nosebleeds</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit your MP as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms.</p>
<h2>Regular blood pressure checks for over over 40's</h2>
<p>The only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked.</p>
<p>Blood pressure checks are usually available on request at most GP surgeries and health clinics. Some surgeries have home monitoring devices available, which you may be able to use at the time of blood pressure medication start up or change. Many also have a policy of arranging regular checks for you.</p>
<p>Adults who are over 40 and have not been diagnosed with high blood pressure should have their blood pressure checked <strong>at least </strong>once every five years. However, your blood pressure should ideally be checked more frequently, particularly if you have any contributory risk factors.</p>
<h2>Causes of high blood pressure</h2>
<p>There are two types of high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary high blood pressure (also known as essential high blood pressure) - has no identifiable cause.</li>
<li>Secondary high blood pressure - is related to an underlying cause, such as kidney disease, or a particular type of medication that you are taking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Primary high blood pressure</h2>
<p>While the specific cause of primary high blood pressure remains unknown, there is compelling evidence to suggest that a number of risk factors increase your chances of developing the condition. </p>
<p>These risk factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>age - the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older</li>
<li>a family history of high blood pressure - the condition seems to run in families</li>
<li>being of Afro-Caribbean or South Asian origin</li>
<li>high-fat diet</li>
<li>high amount of salt in your diet</li>
<li>lack of exercise</li>
<li>being overweight</li>
<li>smoking</li>
<li>excessive alcohol consumption</li>
<li>stress</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of health conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease, have also been linked to an increase risk of developing primary high blood pressure.</p>
<h2>Treating high blood pressure</h2>
<p>Treatment for high blood pressure will depend on your blood pressure levels and your associated risk (after taking account of several factors) of developing a cardiovascular disease, such as a heart attack or <a data-id="20248" href="/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/stroke/" title="Stroke">stroke</a>.</p>
<p>There are seven main risk factors for developing a cardiovascular disease. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li>
<li>smoking (or a previous history of smoking)</li>
<li>obesity</li>
<li>lack of exercise</li>
<li>having a high level of cholesterol in your blood</li>
<li>having a family history of cardiovascular disease (conditions of the heart or blood vessels).</li>
</ul>
<h3>If your blood pressure is slightly high</h3>
<p>If your blood pressure is slightly higher than the ideal level (120/80mmHg), and your GP feels that the risks of cardiovascular disease are low, then you should be able to lower your blood pressure by making simple lifestyle changes (see more below).</p>
<h3>If your blood pressure is moderately high </h3>
<p>If your blood pressure is moderately high (140/90mmHg or higher), or your GP feels that your risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years is more than one in five, then you will be advised about changing your lifestyle and may also be prescribed medication.</p>
<h3>If your blood pressure is very high </h3>
<p>If your blood pressure is very high (180/110 mmHg or above) you should be referred to a hypertension specialist (a doctor who specialises in treating high blood pressure). </p>
<h3>Lifestyle changes</h3>
<p>The following lifestyle changes are known to reduce high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular exercise of at least 30 minutes a day, a minimum of five times a week (e.g. walking, cycling or swimming)</li>
<li>cutting your alcohol intake to recommended levels (less than 21 units a week for men, and less than 14 units a week for women)</li>
<li>eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet, and restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day</li>
<li>losing weight if you are overweight or obese</li>
<li>restricting your caffeine consumption to less than five cups of coffee or tea a day</li>
<li>relaxation therapies, such as yoga and meditation</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you achieve a relatively low decrease in your blood pressure, it can still have significant health benefits.</p>
<h3>Medication</h3>
<p>A number of medications can be used to treat high blood pressure. You may need to take more than one type of medication to lower your blood pressure because a combination of treatments is sometimes needed to successfully treat the condition.</p>
<p>If you have high blood pressure, you may need to take blood pressure-lowering medication for the rest of your life. However, if your blood pressure levels stay under control for several years, you should ask your GP if you could come off your treatment and have your blood pressure monitored.</p>
<p>Most medications that are used to treat high blood pressure have some side effects (see below for details of the specific side effects of each type of medication). Consult your GP immediately if you have any of the following common side effects while taking medication for high blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling drowsy</li>
<li>pain around your kidney area (on the side of your lower back)</li>
<li>a dry cough</li>
<li>dizziness, faintness or light-headedness</li>
<li>a skin rash</li>
</ul>
<p>Research has shown that different blood pressure lowering medications work better for different ethnic groups. For example, ACE inhibitors are more effective as a first-choice medication for treating high blood pressure in white people, whereas calcium channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics, tend to work better for black people.</p>
<p>It is thought that this is because black people tend to have a lower level of renin in their blood. Renin is an enzyme that helps to regulate blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are most effective when there is a high amount of renin in the blood, so they are not as effective in treating black people with high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Therefore, your GP will consider your ethnic background when making a treatment plan.</p>
<p>The most widely used medications for treating high blood pressure are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors </li>
<li>Calcium channel blockers</li>
<li>Thiazide diuretics</li>
<li>Alpha-blockers</li>
<li>Beta-blockers</li>
</ul>
