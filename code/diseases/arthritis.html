            <p>Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.</p>
            <p>In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people of all ages, including children.</p>
            <h2>Types of arthritis</h2>
            <p>The two most common types of arthritis are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
            <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Osteoarthritis</h3>
            <p>Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people.</p>
            <p>It most often develops in adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
            <p>Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.</p>
            <p>Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes.</p>
            <p>Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.</p>
            <p>The most commonly affected joints are those in the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Hands</li>
            <li>Spine</li>
            <li>Knees</li>
            <li>Hips</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Rheumatoid arthritis</h3>
            <p>In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men.</p>
            <p>Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. </p>
            <p>The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.</p>
            <p>People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body. </p>
            <h2>Symptoms of arthritis</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have.</p>
            <p>This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>joint pain, tenderness and stiffness</li>
            <li>inflammation in and around the joints</li>
            <li>restricted movement of the joints</li>
            <li>warm, red skin over the affected joint</li>
            <li>weakness and muscle wasting</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Treating arthritis</h2>
            <p>There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.</p>
            <p>For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including painkillers</p>
            <p>Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Analgesics (painkillers)</li>
            <li>Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) - a combination of treatments is often recommended</li>
            <li>Physiotherapy </li>
            </ul>
