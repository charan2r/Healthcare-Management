            <p>Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.</p>
<p>There are two main types of diabetes - type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.</p>
<p>There are 4.7 million people living with diabetes in the UK. That's more than one in 15 people in the UK who has diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed).</p>
<p>This figure has nearly trebled since 1996, when there were 1.4 million. By 2025, it is estimated that 5 million people will have diabetes in the UK.</p>
<h2>Pre-diabetes</h2>
<p>Many more people have blood glucose levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes.</p>
<p>This is sometimes known as prediabetes. If your blood glucose level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased.</p>
<p>It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.</p>
<h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
<p>You should therefore visit your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms, such as feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual, and feeling tired all the time.</p>
<p>It's also advised to see your GP if you have risk factors of diabetes and are worried about developing diabetes in future.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of diabetes</h2>
<p>The main symptoms of diabetes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling very thirsty</li>
<li>urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night</li>
<li>feeling very tired</li>
<li>weight loss and loss of muscle bulk</li>
<li>itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush</li>
<li>cuts or wounds that heal slowly</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
</ul>
<p>Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over a few hours or even days.</p>
<p>Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.</p>
<h2>What causes diabetes?</h2>
<p>The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).</p>
<p>When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.</p>
<p>However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn't work properly.</p>
<h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
<p>In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body's organs.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. In the UK, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes.</p>
<p>If you're diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you'll need insulin injections for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You'll also need to pay close attention to certain aspects of your lifestyle and health to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced.</p>
<h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn't produce enough insulin, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance.</p>
<p>If you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>However, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, you may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity. Obesity-related diabetes is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset diabetes because it's more common in older people.</p>
<h2>Causes of type 1 diabetes</h2>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them.</p>
<p>Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely <a data-id="6024" href="/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/dehydration/" target="_blank" title="Dehydration">dehydrated</a>.</p>
<p>This results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<h2>Treating type 1 diabetes</h2>
<p>It's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible. If left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It's essential that treatment is started early.</p>
<p>Diabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.</p>
<p>If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.</p>
<p>As your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.</p>
<p>Insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.</p>
<p>Insulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid) acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that's inserted under the skin with a needle.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>islet cell transplantation - where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes</li>
<li>a complete pancreas transplant - this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Causes of type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn't used as fuel for energy.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. Due to increased obesity, type 2 diabetes is now being seen in young people and all ages. It's far more common than type 1 diabetes.</p>
<h2>Treating type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is treated with changes in your diet and depending on the response of your blood glucose levels, sometimes tablets and insulin. Early in the course of type 2 diabetes, planned weight loss can even reverse the disease.</p>

<h2>Complications of type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>Diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It's the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age.</p>
<p>Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p>Diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents.</p>

<h2>Preventing type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>If you're at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>losing weight if you're overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight</li>
<li>eating a healthy, balanced diet</li>
<li>stopping smoking, if you smoke</li>
<li>drinking alcohol in moderation</li>
<li>taking plenty of regular exercise</li>
</ul>
