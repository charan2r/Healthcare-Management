        <div class="editor">
            <p>Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture.</p>
            <p>The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>wrist fractures</li>
            <li>hip fractures</li>
            <li>fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine.</p>
            <p>Osteoporosis isn't usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain.</p>
            <p>Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body.</p>
            <h2>Who's affected?</h2>
            <p>Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK.</p>
            <p>More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis.</p>
            <h2>Causes of osteoporosis</h2>
            <p>Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.</p>
            <p>Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause (when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45).</p>
            <p>Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids</a></li>
            <li>other medical conditions - such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems</li>
            <li>a family history of osteoporosis - particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent</li>
            <li>long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels</li>
            <li>having a low BMI</li>
            <li>heavy drinking and smoking</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Causes of osteoporosis</h2>
            <p>Osteoporosis causes bones to become less dense and more fragile. Some people are more at risk than others.</p>
<p>Bones are at their thickest and strongest in your early adult life and their density increases until your late 20s. You gradually start losing bone density from around the age of 35.</p>
<p>This happens to everyone, but some people develop osteoporosis and lose bone density much faster than normal. This means they're at greater risk of a fracture.</p>
<h2>Risk groups</h2>
<p>Osteoporosis can affect men and women. It's more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people.</p>
<h3>Women</h3>
<p>Women are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density.</p>
<p>The female hormone oestrogen is essential for healthy bones. After the menopause (when monthly periods stop), oestrogen levels fall. This can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.</p>
<p>Women are at even greater risk of developing osteoporosis if they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>AN early menopause (before the age of 45)</li>
<li>Ahysterectomy (removal of the womb) before the age of 45, particularly when the ovaries are also removed</li>
<li>Absent periods for more than six months as a result of overexercising or too much dieting</li>
</ul>
<h3>Men</h3>
<p>In most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. However, there's a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy.</p>
<p>Men continue producing testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.</p>
<p>In around half of men, the exact cause of low testosterone levels is unknown, but known causes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of certain medications, such as oral corticosteroids</li>
<li>Alcohol misuse</a></li>
<li>Hypogonadism (a condition that causes abnormally low testosterone levels)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating osteoporosis</h2>
<h2>Treatment overview</h2>
<p>Although a diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the results of your bone mineral density scan (DEXA or DXA scan), the decision about what treatment you need - if any - is also based on a number of other factors. These include your:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>sex</li>
<li>risk of fracture</li>
<li>previous injury history</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've been diagnosed with osteoporosis because you've had a fracture, you should still receive treatment to try to reduce your risk of further fractures.</p>
<p>You may not need or want to take medication to treat osteoporosis. However, you should ensure you're maintaining sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin D. To achieve this, your healthcare team will ask you about your diet and may recommend making changes or taking supplements.</p>
<h2>Medication for osteoporosis</h2>
<p>A number of different medications are used to treat osteoporosis. Your doctor will discuss the treatments available and make sure the medicines are right for you.</p>
<h3>Bisphosphonates</h3>
<p>Bisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. This maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture.</p>
<p>There are a number of different bisphosphonates, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Alendronate</li>
<li>Etidronate</li>
<li>Ibandronate</li>
<li>Risedronate</li>
<li>Zolendronic acid</li>
</ul>
<p>They're given as a tablet or injection.</p>
<p>You should always take bisphosphonates on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. Stand or sit upright for 30 minutes after taking them. You'll also need to wait between 30 minutes and two hours before eating food or drinking any other fluids.</p>
<p>Bisphosphonates usually take 6 to 12 months to work and you may need to take them for five years or longer. You may also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements to take at a different time to the bisphosphonate.</p>
<p>The main side effects associated with bisphosphonates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>irritation to the oesophagus (the tube that food passes through from the mouth to the stomach)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone will experience these side effects.</p>
