            <p>Most people no longer need to take a coronavirus test. To prevent the spread of infection, you should try to stay at home if unwell. </p>
<p>Coronavirus, and other respiratory infections such as flu, can spread easily and cause serious illness in some people. Vaccinations are very effective at preventing serious illness from coronavirus. But there's still a chance you might catch coronavirus, or another respiratory infection, and pass it on to other people.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>To prevent the spread of coronavirus, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection such as coronavirus and you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a high temperature or</li>
<li>do not feel well enough to go to work or carry out normal activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to do this until you no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) or until you feel better.</p>
<p>Symptoms of coronavirus include:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous cough</li>
<li>high temperature, fever or chills</li>
<li>loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell</li>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>unexplained tiredness, lack of energy</li>
<li>muscle aches or pains that are not due to exercise</li>
<li>not wanting to eat or not feeling hungry</li>
<li>headache that's unusual or longer lasting than usual</li>
<li>sore throat, stuffy or runny nose</li>
<li>diarrhoea</li>
<li>feeling sick or being sick</li>
</ul>
<h3>Speak to your MP if:</h3>
<li>your symptoms worsen</li>
<li>you're concerned about your symptoms</li>
<li>you have symptoms that you can no longer manage at home</li>
<li>you're worried about your child, especially if they're under 2 years</li>
</ul>
<p>If your MP is unreachable, contact 1919.</p>
<h2>Stay at home advice</h2>
<p>There are things you can do to reduce the spread of infection if you have symptoms, have tested positive, or are a close contact.</p>
<p>If you aren't eligible for testing and you have symptoms of a respiratory infection such as coronavirus and have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to go to work or carry out normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Try to do this until you no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) or until you feel better.</p>
<p>If you have a positive coronavirus test result, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for 5 days after the day you took your test, or from the day your symptoms started (whichever was earlier). You should count the day after you took the test as day 1.</p>
<p>If a child or young person aged 18 or under has a positive coronavirus test result, they should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for 3 days after the day they took the test or from the day their symptoms started (whichever was earliest), if they can. Children and young people tend to be infectious for less time than adults.</p>
<h3>If you've had a positive test result, and have completed 5 days of self-isolation</h3>
<p>Although many people will no longer be infectious to others after 5 days, some people may be infectious to other people for up to 10 days from the start of their infection.</p>
<p>If you have a high temperature or still feel unwell after the 5 days, continue to try to stay at home. Try to stay at home until you:</p>
<ul>
<li>feel well enough to go back to normal activities</li>
<li>no longer have a high temperature (if you had one)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will help reduce the risk of spreading the virus.</p>
<p>You should avoid meeting people at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell from coronavirus, especially those whose immune system means that they are at higher risk of serious illness from coronavirus for 10 days after the day you took your test.</p>
