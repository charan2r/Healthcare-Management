            <p>Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of pneumonia</h2>
<p>The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of pneumonia include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cough - which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm)</li>
<li>difficulty breathing - your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting</li>
<li>rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>fever</li>
<li>feeling generally unwell</li>
<li>sweating and shivering</li>
<li>loss of appetite</li>
<li>chest pain - which gets worse when breathing or coughing</li>
</ul>
<p>Less common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>coughing up blood (haemoptysis)</li>
<li>headaches</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>nausea or vomiting</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>joint and muscle pain</li>
<li>feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly people</li>
</ul>
<h2>What causes pneumonia?</h2>
<p>Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae.</p>
<p>Many different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi.</p>
<p>As well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>viral pneumonia - most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children</li>
<li>aspiration pneumonia - caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical</li>
<li>fungal pneumonia - rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system</li>
<li>hospital-acquired pneumonia - pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating pneumonia</h2>
<p>Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home with rest, antibiotics and by drinking plenty of fluids. More severe cases may need hospital treatment.</p>
<p>Unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise, you should always finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better.</p>
<p>If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic.</p>
<p>After starting treatment, your symptoms should steadily improve.</p>
<p>However, how quickly they improve will depend on how severe your pneumonia is. </p>
<p>As a general guide, after:</p>
<ul>
<li>one week - fever should have resolved</li>
<li>four weeks - chest pain and mucus production should have substantially reduced</li>
<li>six weeks - cough and breathlessness should have substantially reduced</li>
<li>three months - most symptoms should have resolved, but you may still feel very tired (fatigue)</li>
<li>six months - most people will feel back to normal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment at home</h2>
<p>Visit your GP if your symptoms don't improve within three days of starting antibiotics.</p>
<p>Symptoms may not improve if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the bacteria causing the infection is resistant to antibiotics - your MP may prescribe a different antibiotic, or they may prescribe a second antibiotic for you to take with the first one</li>
<li>a virus is causing the infection, rather than bacteria -= antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and your body's immune system will have to fight the viral infection by creating antibodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, may help relieve pain and reduce fever.</p>
