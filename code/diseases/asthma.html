        <div class="editor">
            <p>Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness.</p>
<p>The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems.</p>
<p>Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an 'asthma attack', although doctors sometimes use the term 'exacerbation'.</p>
<p>Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.</p>
 
<h2>What causes asthma?</h2>
<p>Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal.</p>
<p>When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs - known as a trigger - your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).</p>
<p>Common asthma triggers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>House dust mites</li>
<li>Animal fur</li>
<li>Pollen</li>
<li>Cigarette smoke</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Viral infections</li>
</ul>
<p>Asthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.</p>
<p>The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition.</p>
<p>Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people.</p>

<h2>Who is affected?</h2>
<p>In the UK, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma.</p>
<p>That's the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men.</p>
<h2>How asthma is treated</h2>
<p>While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition.</p>
<p>Treatment is based on two important goals, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relieving symptoms </li>
<li>Preventing future symptoms and attacks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms of asthma</h2>
<p>The symptoms of asthma can range from mild to severe. Most people will only experience occasional symptoms, although a few people will have problems most of the time.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of asthma are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe)</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>A tight chest - which may feel like a band is tightening around it </li>
<li>Coughing</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms are often worse at night and early in the morning, particularly if the condition is not well controlled. They may also develop or become worse in response to a certain trigger, such as exercise or exposure to an allergen.</p>

<p>Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control the symptoms.</p>
<h2>Asthma attacks</h2>
<p>When asthma symptoms get significantly worse, it is known as an asthma attack or 'acute asthma exacerbation'.</p>
<p>Asthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. It is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>During an asthma attack, the symptoms described above may get worse and - if you're already on treatment - your inhaler medication may not work as well as it normally does.</p>
<p>You might be monitoring your asthma using a device called a peak flow meter, and there may be a drop in your peak expiratory flow. </p>
<p>Signs of a particularly severe asthma attack can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your reliever inhaler (which is usually blue) is not helping symptoms as much as usual, or at all</li>
<li>Wheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant</li>
<li>Being too breathless to eat, speak or sleep</li>
<li>Breathing faster</li>
<li>A rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>Feeling drowsy, exhausted or dizzy</li>
<li>Your lips or fingers turning blue (cyanosis)</li>
</ul>
<p>Phone 1919 to seek immediate help if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe asthma attack.</p>
<h2>Treating asthma</h2>
<h2>1.Reliever inhalers</h2>
<p>Reliever inhalers - usually blue - are taken to relieve asthma symptoms quickly.</p>
<p>The inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. This allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again.</p>
<p>Reliever inhalers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways, so they do not make asthma better in the long term â€“ they are intended only for the relief of symptoms.</p>
<p>Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. They are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused.</p>
<p>However, they should rarely, if ever, be necessary if asthma is well controlled, and anyone needing to use them three or more times a week should have their treatment reviewed.</p>
<p>Everyone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a 'reliever'.</p>

<h2>2.Preventer inhalers</h2>
<p>Preventer inhalers - usually brown, red or orange - work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring.</p>
<p>They must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control.</p>
<p>You will need to use the preventer inhaler daily for some time before you gain the full benefit. You may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler to relieve your symptoms, but your treatment should be reviewed if you continue to need them often.</p>
<p>The preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. Examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone.</p>
<p>Preventer treatment should be taken regularly if you have anything more than occasional symptoms from your asthma, and certainly if you feel the need to use a reliever inhaler more than twice a week.</p>
<p>Some inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. The use of a spacer device also reduces this risk.</p>
<p>Smoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers.</p>

<h2>Other treatments and 'add-on' therapy</h2>
<h3>1.Long-acting reliever inhalers</h3>
<p>If your asthma does not respond to initial treatment, the dose of preventer inhaler you take may be increased in agreement with your healthcare team.</p>
<p>If this does not control your asthma symptoms, you may be given an inhaler containing a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist, or LABA) to take as well.</p>
<p>These work in the same way as short-acting relievers. Although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. This means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover.</p>
<p>Regular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. Examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, like short-acting relievers, long-acting relievers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways. If they are taken without a preventer, this may allow the condition to get worse while masking the symptoms, increasing the chance of a sudden and potentially life-threatening severe asthma attack.</p>
<p>You should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself.</p>
<p>In view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a 'combination' inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device.</p>
<p>Examples of combination inhalers include Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair, Flutiform and Relvar. These are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon.</p>
<h3>2.Other preventer medicines</h3>
<p>If regular efficient administration of treatment with a preventer and a long-acting reliever still fails to control asthma symptoms, additional medicines may be tried. Two possible alternatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leukotriene receptor antagonists - tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways</li>
<li>Theophyllines - tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.Oral steroids</h3>
<p>If your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed regular steroid tablets. This treatment is usually monitored by a respiratory specialist (an asthma specialist).</p>
<p>Oral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset - for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped</li>
<li>when long-term control of asthma remains a problem, despite maximal dosages of inhaled and other medications - in these cases, oral steroids may be given for prolonged periods, or even indefinitely, while maintaining maximum treatment with inhalers as this maximises the chance of being able to stop the oral steroids again in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Long-term use of oral steroids has serious possible side effects, so they are only used once other treatment options have been tried, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your healthcare team.</p>
