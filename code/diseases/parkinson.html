        <div class="editor">
            <p>Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years.</p>
<p>The three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are:</p>
<ul>
<li>involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor)</li>
<li>slow movement</li>
<li>stiff and inflexible muscles</li>
</ul>
<p>A person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>depression and anxiety</a></li>
<li>balance problems - this may increase the chance of a fall</li>
<li>loss of sense of smell anosmis</li>
<li>problems sleeping (insomnia)</li>
<li>memory problems</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seeking medical advice</h2>
<p>See your MP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Your MP will ask about the problems you're experiencing and may refer you to a specialist for further tests.</p>

<h2>Causes of Parkinson's disease</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.</p>
<p>Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible.</p>
<p>The symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually develop gradually and are mild at first.</p>
<p>There are many different symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. Some of the more common symptoms are described below.</p>
<p>However, the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual. It's unlikely that a person with Parkinson's disease would experience all or most of these.</p>
<h2>Main symptoms</h2>
<p>The three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease affect physical movement:</p>
<ul>
<li>tremor - shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and resting</li>
<li>slowness of movement (bradykinesia) - where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps</li>
<li>muscle stiffness (rigidity) - stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps (dystonia)</li>
</ul>
<p>These main symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than Parkinson's disease.</p>
<h2>Treating Parkinson's disease</h2>
<p>There are several therapies that can make living with Parkinson's disease easier and help you deal with your symptoms on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>There are efforts underway to try to increase the availability of these supportive therapies for Parkinson's patients on the NHS.</p>
<p>Your local authority may be able to advise and help you. Ask your local authority for a care and support needs assessment.</p>
<h2>Physiotherapy</h2>
<p>A physiotherapist can work with you to relieve muscle stiffness and joint pain through movement (manipulation) and exercise.</p>
<p>The physiotherapist aims to make moving easier, and improve your walking and flexibility. They also try to improve your fitness levels and ability to manage things for yourself.</p>
<h2>Occupational therapy</h2>
<p>An occupational therapist can identify areas of difficulty in your everyday life - for example, dressing yourself or getting to the local shops.</p>
<p>They can help you work out practical solutions, and ensure your home is safe and properly set up for you. This will help you maintain your independence for as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Speech and language therapy</h2>
<p>Many people with Parkinson's disease have swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) and problems with their speech.</p>
<p>A speech and language therapist can often help you improve these problems by teaching speaking and swallowing exercises, or by providing assistive technology.</p>
<h2>Diet advice</h2>
<p>For some people with Parkinson's disease, making dietary changes can help improve some symptoms.</p>
<p>These changes can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>increasing the amount of fibre in your diet and making sure you're drinking enough fluid to reduce constipation</li>
<li>increasing the amount of salt in your diet and eating small, frequent meals to avoid problems with dizziness when you stand up quickly</li>
<li>making changes to your diet to avoid unintentional weight loss</li>
</ul>
<p>You may see a dietitian, a healthcare professional trained to give diet advice, if your care team thinks you may benefit from changing your diet.</p>
<h2>Medication</h2>
<p>Medication can be used to improve the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as shaking (tremors) and movement problems.</p>
<p>However, not all the medications available are useful for everyone, and the short- and long-term effects of each are different.</p>
<p>Three main types of medication are commonly used:</p>
<ul>
<li>levodopa</li>
<li>dopamine agonists</li>
<li>monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors</li>
</ul>
<p>Your specialist can explain your medication options, including the risks associated with each medication, and discuss which may be best for you. Regular reviews will be required as the condition progresses and your needs change.</p>
