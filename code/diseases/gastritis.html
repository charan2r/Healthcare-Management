            <p>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or gastritis is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet).</p>
<p>It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the <a data-id="5211" href="/illnesses-and-conditions/stomach-liver-and-gastrointestinal-tract/gastro-oesophageal-reflux-disease-gord#causes-of-gord" title="Causes of GORD">causes of GORD</a>.</p>
<p>GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth. It may just be an occasional nuisance for some people, but for others it can be a severe, lifelong problem.</p>
<p>GORD can often be controlled with self-help measures and medication. Occasionally, surgery to correct the problem may be needed.</p>
<h2></h2>Symptoms of GORD</h2>
<p>Symptoms of GORD can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>heartburn (an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest that often occurs after eating)</li>
<li>acid reflux (where stomach acid comes back up into your mouth and causes an unpleasant, sour taste)</li>
<li>oesophagitis (a sore, inflamed oesophagus)</li>
<li>bad breath</li>
<li>bloating and belching</li>
<li>feeling or being sick</li>
<li>pain when swallowing and/or difficulty swallowing</li>
</ul>
<h2 ></h2>What to do if you have GORD</h2>
<p>You can often control the symptoms of GORD by making some lifestyle changes and taking over-the-counter medication.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily need to see your MP if you only have symptoms occasionally. Ask your pharmacist for advice on treatments. </p>
<h2 >When to see your MP</h2>
<p>Visit your MP if you're worried about your symptoms, or if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have symptoms several times a week</li>
<li>over-the-counter medications aren't helping</li>
<li>your symptoms are severe</li>
<li>you have difficulty swallowing</li>
<li>you have possible signs of a more serious problem, such as persistent vomiting, vomiting blood or unexplained weight loss</li>
</ul>
<p>The main symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are heartburn and acid reflux.</p>
<h2>Heartburn</h2>
<p>Heartburn is an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest.</p>
<p>It's usually felt just below your breastbone, but can spread up to the throat in some people.</p>
<p>The discomfort is usually worse after eating, or when bending over or lying down.</p>
<h2>Acid reflux </h2>
<p>Acid reflux is where acid and other stomach contents are brought back up (regurgitated) into your throat and mouth.</p>
<p>It usually causes an unpleasant, sour taste at the back of your mouth.</p>
<h2>Other symptoms</h2>
<p>If you have GORD, you may also experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sore, inflamed oesophagus (oesophagitis)</li>
<li>bad breath</li>
<li>bloating and belching</li>
<li>feeling or being sick</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treating GORD</h2>
<p>Heartburn and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can often be treated with self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines.</p>
<p>If these don't help, your MP can prescribe stronger medication or refer you to a specialist to discuss whether surgery may be an option.</p>
<p>You may find the following measures can help reduce heartburn and other symptoms of GORD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day - don't eat or drink alcohol within 3 or 4 hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening.</li>
<li>Avoid anything you think triggers your symptoms - common triggers include coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, alcohol, and fatty or spicy food.</li>
<li>Don't wear tight clothing - clothes that are tight around your tummy may make your symptoms worse.</li>
<li>Raise the head of your bed by up to 20cm (8 inches) - placing a piece of wood or blocks underneath one end of your bed may reduce symptoms at night; don't just use extra pillows, as this can put a strain on your tummy.</li>
<li>Try to relax - stress can make heartburn and GORD worse, so learning relaxation techniques may help if you're often feeling stressed.</li>
<li>Maintain a healthy weight - if you're overweight, losing weight may help reduce your symptoms.</li>
<li>Stop smoking - smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're taking medication for other health conditions, check with your GP to find out whether they could be contributing to your symptoms.</p>
<p>Different medicines may be available, but don't stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your GP first.</p>
<h2>Medication</h2>
<p>A number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of GORD.</p>
<h3>Over-the-counter medicines</h3>
<p>Over-the-counter heartburn and GORD medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. The main types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>antacids - these neutralise the effects of stomach acid</li>
<li>alginates - these produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid</li>
<li>low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists - see below for more information about these </li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines aren't suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure.</p>
