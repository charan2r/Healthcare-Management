            <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively.</p>
<p>CKD does not usually cause symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. It's usually detected at earlier stages by blood and urine tests.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of advanced kidney disease</h3>
<p>The main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiredness</li>
<li>Swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Blood in the urine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosing chronic kidney disease</h2>
<p>Chronic kidney disease is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.</p>
<p>If you're at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>High blood pressure(hypertension)</li>
<li>Diabetes</a></li>
<li>A family history of CKD</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why does it happen?</h2>
<p>The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. They're located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. The kidneys also:</p>
<ul>
<li>help maintain blood pressure </li>
<li>maintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help heart and muscles function properly</li>
<li>produce the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy </li>
<li>produce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells</li>
</ul>
<p>Chronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. This is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of chronic kidney disease</h2>
<p>Most people with CKD have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function.</p>
<p>In other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only one kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant.</p>
<p>A change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum.</p>
<p>If the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or ERF), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. If kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>weight loss and poor appetite</li>
<li>swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention) </li>
<li>shortness of breath </li>
<li>blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test) </li>
<li>an increased need to urinate, particularly at night </li>
<li>insomnia</li>
<li>itchy skin </li>
<li>muscle cramps</li>
<li>high blood pressure(hypertension)</li>
<li>nausea </li>
<li>erectile dysfunction in men (an inability to get or maintain an erection)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. Many of the symptoms above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear.</p>
<h2>Treating chronic kidney disease</h2>
<h3>Lifestyle changes</h3>
<p>The following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control CKD:</p>
<ul>
<li>stopping smoking</li>
<li>eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet </li>
<li>restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day</li>
<li>not using over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional</li>
<li>moderating your alcohol intake so it is within recommended limits (no more than 3-4 units a day for men and 2-3 units a day for women) </li>
<li>losing weight if you are overweight or obese </li>
<li>doing regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, five times a week</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medications for high blood pressure</h3>
<p>One of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is to manage high blood pressure. Good control of blood pressure is vital to protect the kidneys.</p>
<p>People with CKD should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg.</p>
<p>There are many types of blood pressure drugs. Medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with CKD.</p>
<p>As well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels, ACE inhibitors give additional protection to the kidney.</p>
<p>ACE inhibitors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ramipril </li>
<li>enalapril </li>
<li>lisinopril </li>
<li>perindopril</li>
</ul>
<p>Side effects of ACE inhibitors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a persistent, dry cough </li>
<li>dizziness </li>
<li>tiredness or weakness </li>
<li>headaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough.</p>
