            <p>Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn't diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal.</p>
<p>A single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of malaria</h2>
<p>It's important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you're travelling to areas where there's a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly.</p>
<p>Symptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.</p>
<p>The initial symptoms of malaria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high temperature (fever)</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Sweats</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Muscle aches or pains</li>
<li>Vomiting and or diarrhoea</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.</p>
<h2>When to seek medical attention</h2>
<p>Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly.</p>
<p>The effects of malaria are usually more severe in:</p>
<ul>
<li>babies</li>
<li>young children</li>
<li>pregnant women</li>
<li>older people</li>
</ul>
<h2>What causes malaria?</h2>
<p>Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.</p>
<p>There are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.</p>
<p>All malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. It's not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.</p>
<h2>How malaria is spread</h2>
<p>The Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as 'night-biting' mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.</p>
<p>When a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can't be spread directly from person to person.</p>
<p>When an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. In the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. This is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.</p>
<p>Although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions and sharing needles.</p>
<h3>Preventing and treating malaria</h3>
<p>If you travel to an area that has malaria, you are at risk of the infection. It's very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease and get treatment immediately if symptoms do develop.</p>
<h2>Preventing malaria</h2>
<p>Malaria can often be avoided using the ABCD approach to prevention, which stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness of risk - find out whether you're at risk of getting malaria</li>
<li>Bite prevention - use insect repellent, cover your skin with clothing, and use a mosquito net to avoid mosquito bites</li>
<li>Check whether you need to take antimalarial prevention tablets by visiting a travel health clinic - if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose and finish the course</li>
<li>Diagnosis - seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling</li>
</ul>
<h3>Being aware of the risks</h3>
<p>To check whether you are travelling to a malaria risk area see the fitfortravel .</p>
<p>Visit your local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know that you are travelling to a risk area.</p>
<p>If you grew up in a country where malaria is common, any natural protection will be quickly lost when you move. This means you need to protect yourself from infection if you're now travelling to a risk area, even if thatâ€™s where you grew up.</p>

<h3>Preventing mosquito bites</h3>
<p>Avoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. This is particularly important during early evening and at night when mosquitoes bite.</p>
