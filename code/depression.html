            <p>Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time.</p>
<p>While some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it's actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages - including children. Studies show that around 4% of children in the UK between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious.</p>
<p>With the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.</p>
<h2>Do I have depression?</h2>
<p>Depression has a range of different symptoms, and it can affect everybody differently. The symptoms include feeling very tearful, feeling hopelessness and sadness, and losing interest in things you enjoyed before. It's also common for people with depression to have symptoms of <a data-id="12426" href="/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/anxiety/" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>Physical symptoms happen with depression too - these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains.</p>
<p>If the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. It's common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression.</p>
<p>Severe symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal - as if life is no longer worth living. </p>
<h2>Seeing a doctor about depression</h2>
<p>Big changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. You're also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. However, it's also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason.</p>
<h2>Symptoms and causes of depression</h2>
<p>Symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.</p>
<p>Depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.</p>
<p>Doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mild depression - it has some impact on daily life</li>
<li>Moderate depression - it has a significant impact on your daily life</li>
<li>Severe depression - this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day</li>
</ul>
<p>A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychotic depression</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a list of depression symptoms - it's unlikely that one person would have all of them.</p>
<h3>Psychological depression symptoms include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>continuous sadness or low mood</li>
<li>losing interest in things</li>
<li>losing motivation</li>
<li>not getting any enjoyment in life</li>
<li>feeling tearful</li>
<li>feeling guilty</li>
<li>feeling anxious</li>
<li>feeling irritable</li>
<li>finding it hard to make decisions</li>
<li>feeling intolerant of other people</li>
<li>feeling helpless</li>
<li>feeling hopeless</li>
<li>low self-esteem</li>
<li>feeling worried</li>
<li>thinking about suicide</li>
<li>thinking about harming yourself</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical symptoms include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>speaking or moving slower than usual</li>
<li>aches and pains that can't be explained</li>
<li>losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight</li>
<li>constipation</li>
<li>loss of interest in sex</li>
<li>disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)</li>
<li>loss of energy</li>
<li>changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diagnosing and treating depression</h2>
<p>There's no physical test for depression.</p>
<p>If you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your GP. This is especially important if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have symptoms of depression that aren't getting any better</li>
<li>you have thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
<li>your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them - but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better.</p>
<p>Your GP may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn't another condition causing your depression symptoms, like an underactive thyroid.</p>
<p>When you see your GP, they'll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. These are likely to be about your health, how you're feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Telling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your GP to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. It's important to be as open as possible.</p>
<p>Your conversation with your MP will be confidential. This rule can only be broken if your GP thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.</p>
<h2>Treating depression</h2>
<p>The first place to go is your MP - they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the NHS.</p>
<p>You may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you'd rather not talk to your GP.</p>
<h2>Talking treatments for depression</h2>
<p>There are a number of talking therapies for depression.</p>
<h3>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</h3>
<p>CBT helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. Part of it's recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now.</p>
<p>You can use CBT to learn how to overcome negative thoughts - this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example.</p>
<p>Most people have a course of six to eight CBT sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. Sessions are one-to-one, between you and a CBT-trained counsellor. You might also be offered group CBT.</p>
<h3>Counselling</h3>
<p>Counselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that's currently going on in your life. These can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness.</p>
<p>On the NHS, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. The sessions are confidential.</p>
<p>A counsellor helps you to think about what's going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. They'll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don't tell you what to do.</p>
<h2>Antidepressants</h2>
<p>Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression symptoms. There are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you.</p>
<p>Most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn't the case for everyone. One type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. It can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you.</p>
<p>Side effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other.</p>
<p>If you're prescribed antidepressants, you should see your GP or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication - every week or two for at least four weeks. This is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working.</p>
<p>If the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. People who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer.</p>
<p>Antidepressants aren't addictive. However, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. You can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.</p>
